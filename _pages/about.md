I am a researcher in **Human Genetics** with a focus on **computational and integrative genomics**, particularly in the study of **complex human diseases**.
My research involves the analysis of **single-nucleus multi-omics data**, including transcriptomic and epigenetic layers, to investigate **cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms** underlying disease-relevant cellular heterogeneity.
In parallel, I work on **genetic variation and causal genomics analyses**, with an emphasis on **copy number variation (CNV) / structural variants** and **Mendelian randomization**, to study genetic contributions to disease susceptibility at the population level.
I hold an **M.Sc. in Human Genetics** and am currently **seeking a PhD position** in **genomics, bioinformatics, or computational biology**.
