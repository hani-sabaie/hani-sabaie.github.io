My research involves the analysis of <strong>single-nucleus multi-omics data</strong>, including transcriptomic and epigenetic layers, to investigate <strong>cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms</strong> underlying disease-relevant cellular heterogeneity. In parallel, I work on <strong>genetic variation and causal genomics analyses</strong>, with an emphasis on <strong>copy number variation (CNV) / structural variants</strong> and <strong>Mendelian randomization</strong>, to study genetic contributions to disease susceptibility at the population level. I hold an <strong>M.Sc. in Human Genetics</strong> and am currently <strong>seeking a PhD position</strong> in <strong>genomics, bioinformatics, or computational biology</strong>.</p> </body></html>
