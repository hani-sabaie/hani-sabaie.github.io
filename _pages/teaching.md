I am open to academic and research-related communication, particularly in the areas of:

- Integrative single-cell and multi-omics analysis
- Causal genomics and Mendelian randomization
- Structural variation analysis
- Aging biology
- Collaborative projects, PhD opportunities, and methodological discussions  

For the fastest response, email is preferred.
