   title = {The Regulatory Cross-Talk between microRNAs and Novel Members of the B7 Family in Human Diseases: A Scoping Review},
   abstract = {The members of the B7 family, as immune checkpoint molecules, can substantially regulate immune responses. Since microRNAs (miRs) can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and discuss the regulatory cross-talk between miRs and new B7 family immune checkpoint molecules, i.e., B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H5, butyrophilin like 2 (BTNL2), B7-H6, B7-H7, and immunoglobulin like domain containing receptor 2 (ILDR2). The current study was performed using a six-stage methodology structure and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, ProQuest, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to obtain the relevant records to 5 November 2020. Two authors independently reviewed the obtained records and extracted the desired data. After quantitative and qualitative analyses, we used bioinformatics approaches to extend our knowledge about the regulatory cross-talk between miRs and the abovementioned B7 family members. Twenty-seven articles were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies with different designs reported gene–miR regulatory axes in various cancer and non-cancer diseases. The regulatory cross-talk between the aforementioned B7 family molecules and miRs might provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of various human diseases.},

   title = {Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review},
   abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a distinctive clinical syndrome with several causes and clinical manifestations. Aside from an infectious cause, PD is a rapidly developing neurological disorder with a global rise in frequency. Notably, improved knowledge of molecular pathways and the developing novel diagnostic methods may result in better therapy for PD patients. In this regard, the amount of research on ceRNA axes is rising, highlighting the importance of these axes in PD. CeRNAs are transcripts that cross-regulate one another via competition for shared microRNAs (miRNAs). These transcripts may be either coding RNAs (mRNAs) or non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This research used a systematic review to assess validated loops of ceRNA in PD. The Prisma guideline was used to conduct this systematic review, which entailed systematically examining the articles of seven databases. Out of 309 entries, forty articles met all criteria for inclusion and were summarized in the appropriate table. CeRNA axes have been described through one of the shared vital components of the axes, including lncRNAs such as NEAT1, SNHG family, HOTAIR, MALAT1, XIST, circRNAs, and lincRNAs. Understanding the multiple aspects of this regulatory structure may aid in elucidating the unknown causal causes of PD and providing innovative molecular therapeutic targets and medical fields.},

   title = {Assessing the expression of two post-transcriptional BDNF regulators, TTP and miR-16 in the peripheral blood of patients with Schizophrenia},
   abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder with an unknown pathophysiology. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that has been associated with synapse plasticity, learning, and memory, as well as neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. The importance of neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicity-related components in the pathophysiology of SCZ has been highlighted in research on the neurobiology of this disease. The purpose of this research is to investigate the significant expression of two variables, tristetraprolin (TTP) and miR-16, which are known to be regulators of BDNF expression. Fifty Iranian Azeri SCZ patients were enrolled, and fifty healthy volunteers were age- and gender-matched as controls. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction measured the expression levels of the TTP and miR-16 in the peripheral blood (PB) of SCZ patients and healthy people. TTP expression levels in patients were higher than in controls, regardless of gender or age (posterior beta = 1.532, adjusted P-value = 0.012). TTP and miR-16 expression levels were found to be significantly correlated in both SCZ patients and healthy controls (r = 0.701, P < 0.001 and r = 0.777, P < 0.001, respectively). Due to the increased expression of TTP in SCZ and the existence of a significant correlation between TTP and miR-16, which helps to act on target mRNAs with AU-rich elements, this mechanism can be considered an influencing factor in SCZ.},

   title = {Neurotrophin growth factors and their receptors as promising blood biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease: a gene expression analysis study},
   abstract = {Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurological ailment affecting more than 50 million individuals globally, distinguished by a deterioration in memory and cognitive abilities. Investigating neurotrophin growth factors could offer significant contributions to understanding AD progression and prospective therapeutic interventions.

Methods and results
The present investigation collected blood samples from 50 patients diagnosed with AD and 50 healthy individuals serving as controls. The mRNA expression levels of neurotrophin growth factors and their receptors were measured using quantitative PCR. A Bayesian regression model was used in the research to assess the relationship between gene expression levels and demographic characteristics such as age and gender. The correlations between variables were analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficients, and the diagnostic potential was assessed using a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. NTRK2, TrkA, TrkC, and BDNF expression levels were found to be considerably lower (p-value < 0.05) in the blood samples of AD patients compared to the control group. The expression of BDNF exhibited the most substantial decrease in comparison to other neurotrophin growth factors. Correlation analysis indicates a statistically significant positive association between the genes. The ROC analysis showed that BDNF exhibited the greatest Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.76, accompanied by a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. TrkC, TrkA, and NTRK2 demonstrated considerable diagnostic potential in distinguishing between cases and controls.

Conclusion
The observed decrease in the expression levels of NTRK2, TrkA, TrkC, and BDNF in AD patients, along with the identified associations between specific genes and their diagnostic capacity, indicate that these expressions have the potential to function as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.},
